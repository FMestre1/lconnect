Description: This package provides functions to upload vectorial data and derive
landscape connectivity metrics in habitat/matrix systems. Additionally, it 
provides an approach to assess individual patch contribution to the overall 
landscape connectivity, enabling the prioritization of patches. The computation 
of landscape connectivity and patch importance are very useful in Landscape 
Ecology research.
